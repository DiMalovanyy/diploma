    abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First posed as a challenge in 1978 by Rivest&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; et al.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, fully homomorphic encryption—the ability to evaluate any function over encrypted data—was only solved in 2009 in a breakthrough result by Gentry (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Commun. ACM&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 2010). After a decade of intense research, practical solutions have emerged and are being pushed for standardization.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This paper explains the inner-workings of TFHE, a torus-based fully homomorphic encryption scheme. More exactly, it describes its implementation on a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;discretized&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; version of the torus. It also explains in detail the technique of the programmable bootstrapping. Numerous examples are provided to illustrate the various concepts and definitions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
