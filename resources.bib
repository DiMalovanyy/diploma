    abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First posed as a challenge in 1978 by Rivest&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; et al.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, fully homomorphic encryption—the ability to evaluate any function over encrypted data—was only solved in 2009 in a breakthrough result by Gentry (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Commun. ACM&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, 2010). After a decade of intense research, practical solutions have emerged and are being pushed for standardization.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This paper explains the inner-workings of TFHE, a torus-based fully homomorphic encryption scheme. More exactly, it describes its implementation on a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;discretized&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; version of the torus. It also explains in detail the technique of the programmable bootstrapping. Numerous examples are provided to illustrate the various concepts and definitions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

The privacy concerns can be satisfactorily addressed if users encrypt the data they send to the cloud. If the encryption scheme is homomorphic, the cloud can still perform meaningful computations on the data, even though it is encrypted.In fact, we now know a number of constructions of fully homomorphic encryption schemes that allow arbitrary computation on encrypted data. In the last two years, solutions for fully homomorphic encryption have been proposed and improved upon, but it is hard to ignore the elephant in the room, namely efficiency -- can homomorphic encryption ever be efficient enough to be practical? Certainly, it seems that all known fully homomorphic encryption schemes have a long way to go before they can be used in practice. Given this state of affairs, our contribution is two-fold.First, we exhibit a number of real-world applications, in the medical, financial, and the advertising domains, which require only that the encryption scheme is "somewhat" homomorphic. Somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, which support a limited number of homomorphic operations, can be much faster, and more compact than fully homomorphic encryption schemes.Secondly, we show a proof-of-concept implementation of the recent somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, whose security relies on the "ring learning with errors" (Ring LWE) problem. The scheme is very efficient, and has reasonably short ciphertexts. Our unoptimized implementation in magma enjoys comparable efficiency to even optimized pairing-based schemes with the same level of security and homomorphic capacity. We also show a number of application-specific optimizations to the encryption scheme, most notably the ability to convert between different message encodings in a ciphertext.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security Workshop}, pages = {113–124}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {magma, fully homomorphic encryption, ring learning with errors, lattices}, location = {Chicago, Illinois, USA}, series = {CCSW '11} }

With such scheme, anybody can perform arbitrary computations over authenticated data and produce a short tag that authenticates the result of the computation (without knowing the secret key). This tag can be verified using the secret key to ensure that the claimed result is indeed the correct output of the specified computation over previously authenticated data (without knowing the underlying data). For example, Alice can upload authenticated data to ``the cloud'', which then performs some specified computations over this data and sends the output to Bob, along with a short tag that convinces Bob of correctness. Alice and Bob only share a secret key, and Bob never needs to know Alice's underlying data. Our construction relies on fully homomorphic encryption to build fully homomorphic message authenticators.",
